**Auto Quantification White Area**
This ImageJ macro is designed to automatically quantify the white area in an image. It is useful for analyzing images of cells, tissues, and other biological samples.

**Installation**
1. Download and install ImageJ (preferably [Fiji distribution](https://fiji.sc/))
2. Download the auto_quantification_white_area.ijm file from this repository.
3. Open ImageJ and drag the auto_quantification_white_area.ijm file into the ImageJ window.
4. The macro will now be available in the ImageJ menu under Plugins > Macros > auto_quantification_white_area.

**Usage**
 It should now be open in a new window with easy intructions to follow on the top.
 Do not change any other lines besides the ones intructed, unless you know what you are doing.
 The macro will automatically detect the white area in the image, display the results in a table, and save a copy of the image with the quantified area drawn.
